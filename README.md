# rounded-dirichlet-noise
A simple Shiny app that carries out the following steps:
1. Draw a k-dimensional symmetric Dirichlet random variable with parameter alpha = 1.
2. Round the result to two decimal places.
3. Choose a component at random and replace it with one minus the sum of the other coordinates, so that the sum of all components equals one.
4. Plot the values.
